Subject: [PATCH 22/72] Editor: Disable magnifier position animation

In my opinion, this animation serves no purpose because it doesn't
correspond to any animations in the text selection/handle flow, and is
barely noticeable in typical text selection cases. In addition, it makes
the magnifier feel slow/laggy when selecting a large block of text
quickly.
