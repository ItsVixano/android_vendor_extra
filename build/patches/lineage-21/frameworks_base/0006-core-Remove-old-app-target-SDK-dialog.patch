Subject: [PATCH 06/12] core: Remove old app target SDK dialog

If an app is old, users should already know that, and there's usually no
point in warning them about it because they would already be using a
newer version if one existed. Sometimes, using an old app is necessary
for one reason or another, so remove this annoyance and let the user use
their old app in peace.

[ItsVixano: Nuke ABI dialog as well]
